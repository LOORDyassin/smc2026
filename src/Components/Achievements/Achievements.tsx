This memorable edition was a collaborative initiative by IEEE IAS, SMC, CS, and WIE ISIMS SBC at the Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax — with participants joining from student branches all over Tunisia .
From thought-provoking panels and enriching workshops to the vibrant energy of the Bedoui Lounge, TRC 2.0 offered more than just coding — it was a celebration of talent, community, and inspiration.

🎤 The Bedoui Lounge turned into the heart of TRC: laughter, karaoke, unexpected talents, and shared moments that made us forget the hustle — a true space to chill, recharge, and shine!

🧠 Alongside the fun, participants engaged in hands-on workshops, insightful panel discussions, and inspiring talks led by invited experts. From tech trends to career development, TRC 2.0 was a space for learning, sharing, and elevating ideas.

🚀 Our challengers brought passion and drive into every line of code and every pitch. With bold ideas and confident storytelling, they turned visions into impactful realities.

🏆 Huge congratulations to all the winners — your innovation lit the way and made TRC 2.0 an unforgettable journey.  

This was more than a hackathon.  
It was a movement.
